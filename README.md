# Market Watch
  Just a chart displaying Apple stock prices according to time periods.
  This app is using vue-chartkick for displaying the data.
  I am planing on upgrading it to Highcharts soon to have a better display.
  
## Project setup
Download / clone and then NPM install for the dependencies.
